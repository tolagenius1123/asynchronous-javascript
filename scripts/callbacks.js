// A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action.

// Synchronous Programming
// Program is executed by the computer is a sequential order from top to bottom so each task is completed before next one begins

// console.log("This is the first step");
// console.log("This is the second step");
// prompt("are you having a good day? Yes or No");
// console.log("This is the third step");

// Asynchronous Programming
// multiple tasks in a program are executed simultaneously rather than executing them one after the other.

// console.log("This is the first step");
// console.log("This is the second step");
// setTimeout(() => {
// 	prompt("are you having a good day? Yes or No");
// }, 5000);
// console.log("This is the third step");

// What are the disadvantages of using callbacks to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript
